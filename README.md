# Weather and Vacation Analysis

I created a Python script to visualize the weather for over 500 random cities around the world, and another script to pare those cities down to ones that fit my ideal vacation destination criteria. The code used for each ecercise can be found in the Instructions folder.

# Observations for WeatherPy

1. Highest temperatures are found at or near 0 latitude. As latitude increases or ddecreases, temperatures drop dramatically.

2. Latitude appears to have no influence on Cloudiness or Wind Speed.

3. Humidity percentages decrease sharply as you near each pole, with the highest humidity readings clustered in the -20 to +20 latitude range.


# VacationPy

Below is a heatmap of the cities fitting my ideal weather criteria.
